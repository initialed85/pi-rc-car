# pi-rc-car

This repo contains my attempts at driving a [Tamiya Lunch Box](https://www.tamiya.com/english/products/58347lunchbox/index.htm) via a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)

I've broken my attempts into phases; all the content for each phase is in the the relevant folder.
